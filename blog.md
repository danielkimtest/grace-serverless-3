# EcoMaps

## About Me

Grace Wilcox is a junior pursuing a BS in computer engineering with minors in French and electrical engineering. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Grace is thrilled to be exploring the world of computer design and development, an interest of hers since middle school. This summer, Grace participated in the Serverless BitCamp, where she learned about Serverless functions, back end development using Node.js, and front end UI design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. She hopes to use these skills for a project she is leading through Case’s Undergraduate Student Government: a mobile application that will provide basic campus information like bus routes, dining hall menus, and an interactive campus map. In her free time, Grace enjoys playing the guitar, baking, and hanging out with friends and family.

## The Premise

**Traveling somewhere? Know your carbon emissions.**

Remember meeting your friends for dinner last week? How about your daily commute to work? Do you know how much gasoline you burned? 

**EcoMaps can help you know your carbon footprint.**

Every day, people all around the world - including you and me - drive cars to work and school. Not only are cars needed for day to day life, they are also quintessential to the classic road trip, along with so many other recreational activities. Cutting cars out of our lives is clearly unthinkable, but it is important that each and everyone of us reflects upon the impact our lifestyles have on the environment.

Did you know that the typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year (1)? The accumulation of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps heat from the sun, causing the Earth to warm which, in turn, affects the climate (2).

Living a carbon neutral lifestyle may be near impossible, but being aware of how our daily lives affect climate change and adjusting our habits can make a huge difference - which is where EcoMaps comes in!

**How does EcoMaps work?**

EcoMaps is a web app that allows you to compare routes based on their carbon emissions. You simply need to provide your starting point and destination, and a bit of information about your vehicle, and EcoMaps will give you however many potential routes you desire, showing you the carbon footprint for each route. 

Using route and map data from MapQuest’s API3, and carbon footprint estimation technology from the Carbon Interface API4, EcoMaps delivers reliable and accurate information. Microsoft Azure’s Function App5 is used to communicate between the APIs and UI webpage.

**Why did I create EcoMaps?**

As someone who has always been passionate about the environment, I knew I wanted to use my interest in programming to create something that actively fights climate change. Even though the climate crisis is too big for any one person to solve alone, the little actions of each and every one of us add up to make a huge difference, which is why I decided to focus on something that affects nearly everyone: transportation. Whether someone is planning a cross country drive or simply wants to evaluate their drive to work, I want them to be able to consider not only drive time or traffic, but their impact on the environment with each trip they take.

Ultimately, I hope to empower drivers to do their part in mitigating the climate crisis and protecting our beautiful planet that we call home.

Join me in saving the planet!
